# BVV Marketplace Front-end Setup

## Vue Cli

```
vue ui
```

All the below commands can be run from the tasks section `http://localhost:8000/`

I would recommend the Watch command task as we are using this to auto compile Tailwind v2 which now supports [JIT](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode#enabling-jit-mode)

## Project setup

```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
yarn serve
```

### Same as serve accept watches for changes with JIT enabled

```
yarn watch
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
yarn build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
yarn lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
